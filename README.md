### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm walid el jaimi.
Software engineer from Morocco :morocco:.
Computer science is a field that I have been passionate about since my childhood, I try every day to improve my skills and deepen my knowledge by making applications, doing internships, participating in competitions to solve problems every time I have the chance. For me, the design and implementation of IT solutions is not a mission but a pleasure.
